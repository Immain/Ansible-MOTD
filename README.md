## âœ… Key Features:

- Dynamic Message: The script enables the generation of dynamic messages by incorporating various system-related variables, including hostname, IP address, current date and time, system load, and more.
- Customization: Administrators can easily customize the MOTD content according to their specific needs and preferences by modifying the script's variables and templates.
- Maintenance Mode: During system maintenance or planned downtime, administrators can activate a maintenance mode to display specific messages to users, notifying them about the ongoing work and expected downtime.
- Version Control: By leveraging Ansible, the script ensures consistent deployment and version control across multiple servers, making it convenient for managing MOTD configurations in large-scale environments.


## ðŸ“¦ Getting Started:
- Clone the Ansible MOTD Script repository.
- Customize the MOTD message template and variables to fit your requirements.
- Execute the Ansible playbook to deploy the updated MOTD configurations to your target servers.
- Enjoy an enhanced login experience for your users with personalized and dynamic messages!
- Or if you're a tinkerer, use the following to steps to create your own file path and MOTD

### Step 1:
Create a directory for your Ansible Playbooks
```
sudo mkdir /Path/To/File/Ansible/MOTD
```
Change directories into your MOTD folder
```
cd /Path/To/File/Ansible/MOTD
```
### Step 2:
Using the command below, we will setup our roles folder needed for the MOTD:
```
sudo ansible-galaxy init /Path/To/File/roles/motd
```
### Step 3:
Change directories into the roles folder you just created:
```
cd /Path/To/File/roles/motd
```
in the MOTD directory, create a new directory called templates
```
sudo mkdir templates
```
### Step 4:
Within the templates folder, create a jinja file called 96-access-warning.j2
```
sudo nano 96-access-warning.j2
```
Inside the Jinja template, paste the following:
```
#!/bin/sh
echo
echo "
  ____  _____ ______     _______ ____    _   _    _    __  __ _____ 
 / ___|| ____|  _ \ \   / / ____|  _ \  | \ | |  / \  |  \/  | ____|
